Hi, my name is Justin Mathieu. I am the lead applications developer at [Sendik's Food Markets](http://www.sendiks.com). I graduated in 2009 from Waukesha County Technical College with a an Associates Degree in Applied Science. I am highly driven as a developer, and always working to keep up on new practices and developments in the fast changing landscape of software.

I was born and raised in Milwaukee, and have lived in the area my entire life. I've been passionate about programming since middle school, starting with [Dark Basic](https://www.thegamecreators.com/product/dark-basic-pro-open-source) making small 3D experiences and games. As I grew older I moved to the much less 3D focused world of C# and the .net framework, and then got into the ever changing world of web development, where there are always new frameworks to learn (literally, there seems to be a new framework out there every week!).

In 2011 I was hired as an IT assistant / Programmer at Sendik's Food Markets, a small Wisconsin chain of family run grocery stores. The company puts a focus on technology, such as adding digital signage screens to every store location and being one of the first grociers in the area to offer a full [eCommerce](https://www.sendiks.com/shop) website. Since being hired, I have worked hard on developing solutions for their growing needs, such as creating [NTEP certified](http://www.ncwm.net/_resources/dyn/files/75738228z85c33f6a/_fn/17-040.pdf) price calculating scales, an online holiday ordering system, and warehouse managemnt software for their first warehouse purchased in 2013. Now I am the lead software developer, responsible for the maintenance of existing systems and architecting of new systems.

Besides work I enjoy traveling, including recent trips to Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, and international trips to Japan, South Korea, England, France, and many other countries!
